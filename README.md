# DSA
Data Structures and Algorithms, acronym of DSA, is a fundamental part of Computer Science that teaches us how to think and solve complex problems systematically. 

# Purpose
I am studying DSA now, so I would like to write it up here from scratch. This repository can be a blog site. If you would love to contribute, YES, YOU CAN!
